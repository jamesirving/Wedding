  - heading: Should I bring a gift?
    detail: Gifts are not at all necessary, your presence at our wedding is honestly
      the best present we could ask for. If you did wish to contribute to our
      honeymoon, weâ€™ll have a wishing well there on the day. Love and thanks.
  - heading: Can I bring my child/children?
    detail: Unfortunately, no. We hope you will understand our decision to make the
      wedding children free and take this opportunity to let your hair down and
      celebrate a night of freedom.
